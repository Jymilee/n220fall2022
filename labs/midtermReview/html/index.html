    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I struggled extremely hard with these two exercises, spending a stupid amount of time on each of them. Even then, I could 
        only complete the first exercise and I knew that I was doing it wrong because I repeated myself a ton, but could not 
        figure out how to do a for loop with the results I needed. The second exercise honestly feels impossible to figure out 
        without doing some serious external research because the text and lecture examples aren't as complex and then the outside 
        research is more complex than the exercises. I feel very frustrated because if I can't figure it out now then I won't be able
        to figure it out for the midterm because there isn't any sort of feedback listed when grading and there won't be answers 
        provided prior to the exam. <br>

        Anyways, I attempted to write each of these out in english before moving into the code because they were very complex. It 
        didn't get me very far, but it was somewhat helpful. I used a variety of online resources, referenced the textbook, and 
        rewatched the lectures.
